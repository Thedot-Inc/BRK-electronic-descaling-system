  BRK systems structure water device induces ceramic magnetic field inside the pipe
line to the water molecules during the water flow thro piping system. This field forces the
dissolved calcium and magnesium bicarbonate ions to create the crystallizing nuclei of
calcium and magnesium carbonate in the bulk of the water. These micro crystals
continuously grow (the snowball effect) and they flow with the water in the form of
suspended particles. Their size and shape is muchdifferent to those formed in
untreatedwater, they don\`t stick at the piping walls, heating elements of boilers or washing
machines and they remain in suspension until discharged to drain.`,
description2 = `
  
These changes in the molecular structure of the water by converting High sized, Low
Energy Molecules to Low sized, High Energy Molecules. There by reducing the Surface
tension in the water to a greater extent and increase the Dissolved Oxygen Levels to 6-8%.
As the by-products of the precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) from the
solution of calcium bicarbonate (Ca (HCO3)2) in the water, the carbon dioxide is released
into the water. Carbon dioxide dissolved in unsaturated water (with much lesser amount of
dissolved calcium ions) allows dissolving and softening old scale layers in the pipes, heating
elements, heat exchangers etc.`,
description3 = `

Mechanical force of water flow accelerates this descaling process. The dissolving of
old scale deposits requires the water flow through the pipes. If there is no flow, unsaturated
water with carbon dioxide cannot dissolve existing scale. From this all results that after
installation of DESCALER device in older water systems with scale deposits, the water from
the tap may temporarily contain even higher amount of calcium than untreated water. The 
time of descaling process depends on water usage`,
